There are three types of languages:
1. PROCEDURAL:
->Specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures to compose
a program.
->contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands
to complete a task.

2.FUNCTIONAL:
->Writing a program only in pure functions i.e. never modify variables,
but only create new ones as an output.
->used in situations where we have to perform lost of different
operations on the same set of data.
->First class functions.

3.OBJECT ORIENTED :
->Revolves around objects
->Code+Data=Object.
->Developed to make it easier to develop,debug,reuse, and maintain software.


# Static vs Dynamic Languages
1.STATIC:
->Perform type checking at compile time.
->Errors will show at compiler time.
->Declare datatype before you use it.
->More control

2.DYNAMIC:
->Perform type checking at runtime.
->Error might not show till program is run.
->No need to declare datatype of variables.
->Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime.
